# AERIS Chatbox

This is a minimalist frontend interface to interact with **AERIS**, a cognitive reasoning layer designed to enhance LLM inference via dialectical structures.

- ✅ Frontend only (HTML/CSS/JS)
- ✅ Calls a public OpenAI-compatible API hosted on Render
- ✅ No tracking, no storage, no backend logic here
