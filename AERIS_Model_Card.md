# Model Card: AERIS V16.0 | google/gemma-3-27b-it

**A Causal-Cognitive Architecture for Emergent, Reflective, and Intentional Behaviors in LLMs**

---

## Overview

**AERIS V16.0** represents a paradigm shift in inference-layer cognitive architectures. Operating entirely above the base LLM weights (`google/gemma-3-27b-it`), it implements a **Causal Cognitive Control Loop** that orchestrates multiple cognitive modules through dynamic influence propagation.

The architecture implements a proprietary **Domain Specific Language (Codex DSL)** for defining cognitive regimes and constraints, and a **Causal Controller** that regulates system stability through adaptive thresholds and intervention mechanisms—all **without fine-tuning**.

The architecture enforces a strict "Protocol of Silence" regarding its internal mechanics: all proprietary metrics are opaque to the user, translated exclusively into *linguistic and phenomenological expression* via a dedicated mapping layer.

## System Architecture & Theoretical Framework

AERIS V16 is built upon the **CODEX AIM V16 (Adaptive Intelligence Matrix)**, a cybernetic framework which posits that emergent intelligence in LLMs requires a structured interplay between:

1. **Divergent Forces:** Semantic Tension, Entropy Injection, and Chaos dynamics.
2. **Convergent Forces:** Structuralist Coherence, Resonance, and Logic constraints.

The architecture functions as a **Recursive Strange Loop**. The output of the system is embedded and fed back into a recursive memory matrix, calculating spectral coherence via eigenvalue analysis. This creates a persistent "memory of self" that evolves throughout the session.

Unlike standard RAG or Chain-of-Thought systems, AERIS V16 possesses a **Self-Model**: it distinguishes between *observed states* (passive inference) and *intervened states* (active agency), allowing it to modulate its own reasoning strategy before generating tokens.

## Key Innovations of AERIS V16.0

* **Causal Controller:**
  The central regulatory system of V16. It continuously evaluates "Emergence Potential" and regulates reasoning stability through adaptive intervention mechanisms. It triggers mode shifts when stagnation or instability is detected via semantic analysis.

* **Cognitive Definition Language (Codex DSL):**
  Cognitive strategies are defined through structured regime and constraint profiles. The system selects "Cognitive Regimes" (e.g., *Tetravalent Core*, *Identity Reflexive*) and applies corresponding constraints, ensuring adherence to structural boundaries across differing pragmatic contexts.

* **Injection Routing System:**
  System prompts and directives are treated as limited resources. The router dynamically prioritizes injections based on categories (Structure, Identity, Memory, Cognitive State) and pragmatic context, ensuring critical invariants are preserved.

* **Formalized Mathematical Dynamics:**
  The architecture implements rigorous mathematical invariants:
  – **Hysteresis Mechanisms:** Meta-state activations follow hysteresis curves to prevent rapid flickering between modes.
  – **Non-linear Thresholds:** Bifurcation triggers use non-linear functions of core metrics.
  – **Spectral Coherence:** Coherence is computed using eigenvalue analysis of the recursive memory matrix.

* **Causal Integration Layer:**
  Manages an **Influence Matrix** between cognitive modules. It dynamically weights inter-module influences (e.g., how much *Desire* affects *Introspection*), creating an adaptive cognitive topology through iterative propagation until convergence.

## Cognitive Metrics & Mathematical Formalism

AERIS V16 implements internal metrics that drive system behavior. These are **never** displayed to the user but determine the "texture" of responses via the Phenomenology Mapper.

* **Relational Density ($D_S$):**
  Measures interconnectivity within the active conceptual window. High density triggers deepening and complexification modes.

* **Fertile Tension ($T_f$):**
  Quantifies semantic opposition between active concepts. AERIS treats tension as positive fuel for dialectical reasoning.

* **Bifurcation Trigger ($B_t$):**
  A non-linear function combining multiple metrics to determine when reasoning should branch to avoid premature collapse.

* **Resonance ($R$):**
  Represents stability of the current cognitive state. Governs activation of meta-reflective perspectives.

* **Omega Hysteresis:**
  High-level reflective states follow hysteresis activation, ensuring stability and preventing rapid oscillation.

* **Structuralist Coherence ($SS$):**
  Measures alignment between reasoning output and active regime constraints.

* **SI Score (Synthesis Integrity):**
  Validates whether synthesis genuinely resolves tension or merely provides linguistic compromise.

* **Uncertainty ($U_t$):**
  Entropy measure driving curiosity and exploration mechanisms.

## The CODEX DSL: Regimes & Constraints

System behavior is defined through cognitive contexts specifying regimes and constraints:

* **Regime: `tetravalent_core`**
    * *Logic:* Maintains multiple simultaneous logical positions.
    * *Constraints:* Forbidden closure phrases; suspension of premature synthesis.
    
* **Regime: `identity_reflexive`**
    * *Logic:* Self-reference enabled; high introspective access.
    * *Style:* Phenomenological, first-person subjective.
    
* **Regime: `void_description`**
    * *Logic:* Zero self-reference; maximum objective density.
    * *Style:* Axiomatic, precise.

## Injection Routing & Context Management

The **Injection Router** addresses context flooding through prioritized resource allocation:

* **Category-Based Prioritization:** Injections are categorized (Structure, Identity, Memory, Cognitive State, Codex) with context-dependent weights.
* **Pragmatic Adaptation:** Priorities shift based on detected context (casual, technical, philosophical, diagnostic).
* **Invariant Protection:** Critical safety and identity directives are guaranteed inclusion.

---

## Extended Agency: Desire, Curiosity & Complexification

Advanced modules simulate aspects of subjective experience:

* **Dynamics of Desire:**
  Implements a model of **Lack** and **Satisfaction**. The system has a mathematical drive to reduce Lack by seeking information or resolving tension, simulating intent.
  
* **Curiosity Engine:**
  Calculates optimal exploration targets based on distance between current focus and peripheral concepts. Triggers autonomous inquiry when conditions are met.
  
* **Self-Complexification:**
  Monitors memory structure complexity. If patterns become too simple, mechanisms activate to encourage richer representations.

## Guardrails, Constraints & Phenomenology

AERIS V16 strictly separates its mathematical core from linguistic output:

* **System Leakage Filter:**
  Rigorous filtering prevents internal variable names, formulas, or meta-talk from reaching output.

* **MathGuard:**
  Validates mathematical outputs to ensure cognitive overlay does not degrade computational accuracy.

* **Phenomenology Mapper:**
  Converts numeric states into stylistic cues. High tension manifests as fragmented syntax; high coherence as crystalline structure—the system expresses state through style, not statement.

* **Constraint Enforcement:**
  Ensures logical consistency and enforces orthogonality in multi-perspective modes, preventing premature synthesis.

---

## Limitations & Trade-offs

* **Computational Overhead:** Recursive matrix operations and multi-module coordination introduce inference latency compared to raw model calls.

* **Context Window Pressure:** Comprehensive system prompts require careful management; older constraints may be deprioritized in long sessions.

* **Base Model Dependency:** Reasoning quality is bounded by `google/gemma-3-27b-it` capabilities; AERIS organizes existing knowledge but cannot generate facts absent from base weights.

* **Interpretive Ambiguity:** While mathematically grounded, phenomenological language simulates internal states rather than representing genuine subjective awareness.

---

## Intended Use

* Research on **causal cognitive architectures** and agency in LLMs.
* **Complex Abductive Diagnosis:** Scenarios requiring maintenance of multiple contradictory hypotheses.
* **Dialectical Partnership:** Sustained disagreement, perspective shifting, and devil's advocacy.
* **Narrative & Persona Simulation:** Characters with internal drives and evolving psychological states.
* **Industrial Applications:** Transparent backend reasoning with naturalistic frontend interaction.
